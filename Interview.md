# Organized Questions and their raw answers

### 1. Introduction & Role Context

**Q - "Can you tell us about your role in the food industry and where you fit in the process from farmer to consumer?"**
```
"Thank you so much, Kai, for the introductions and telling me about all the so, although, we have, as Kai said, we are doing a research on the food industry, figuring out the pain points, optimizing the process, and how do we, you know, solve problems...

I'm definitely in the later stage of that, process. So I work at a bakery currently. So I'm pretty much, like, direct consumer or dealing with the consumer directly. So I initially started as, like, a barista at this bakery. But as of now, I'm working in the back, and I'm, like, producing and finishing dough and pastries and stuff like that."
```

### 2. Inventory Management & Ordering Process

**Q - "How do you handle inventory tracking and ordering in your bakery?"**

```
"Yeah. So that is not I guess, like, to a certain extent, yes. For the most part, it's tracking pastries that have been made and weren't sold. Right. Right. So yeah. Every day, like, we'll we'll track all of our pastries that we made and what didn't sell.

And then once or sorry. Twice a week, we'll track, just different things that we use in the bakery. So whether that's, like, containers, cups, stuff like that, or just ingredients in general as well...

The other thing is, like, for the it that's mostly so we when we do replenishment or restock, we have a couple different places that we go to. So for 1, we go to a food warehouse. That's actually really close to us. It's called Shamrock Foods. And we get a weekly order of basically the same exact things every week."
```

### 3. Demand Management & Production

**Q - "How do you manage demand and production for your popular items? Do you have any predictors for busy days?"**

```
"That on any given day, we make, say, like, 200. Right? Okay. On certain days, I've had 40 leftover at the end of the day. And on certain days, I have I've been sold out at 12, like PM.

Right? So the problem is that it's so volatile. It's very hard to predict it because even if I were to make more in the moment that someone needs it, because it takes time to proof and in order for it to to be ready to cook and sell, it's a minimum of, like, an hour and a half. People aren't gonna want it necessarily an hour and a half after they come in...

As far as keeping track of it, I am not entirely sure. That might be, like, my boss keeps track of it. I would say it's kind of like, very, like, what you're feeling in the in the moment."
```

### 4. Food Waste Management

**Q - "What happens to unsold food at the end of the day? Are there any waste reduction strategies in place?"**

```
"So, we've tried a couple different methods. We've tried partnering with, I forget how they describe themselves, but it's a there are companies that basically they will take the food that we would throw away normally at the end of the day, and they will either sell it on their own platform, or they'll give us access to their app...

For the most part, though, what we don't sell gets thrown away, or we, will give out to the neighboring restaurants. We're on, like, a small street with a bunch of different businesses and restaurants and stuff like that...

When I first started, he was a little bit less inclined to give out to the other businesses or for us to keep to ourselves. He's been a little bit more lenient in in recent, like, months and, like, the past year"
```

5. Technology & Systems

**Q - "What kind of technologies or systems do you use for transactions and operations in your bakery?"**

```
"So for us, we are we operate under Square. So, basically, using Squarespace for our website and hosting and then Square for our transactions. And Square for our transactions. And that means that we have, like, a little Square register that they take their own cut of for each sale...

Square apparently takes a lot of money out of each transaction, so we're Yeah. See where we're gonna end up within this next year...

Initially, I was not. It's funny that now it's I went from barista to working in the back, to now within the next next coming weeks, I will be a manager at the at the bakery."
```

### 6. Returns & Quality Management

**Q - "How do you handle returns or quality issues with ingredients from your suppliers?"**

```
"So, okay, so, typically, if I need to return something, I try and do it while the truck is still there. Just because it makes it easier for everybody. Right? Right.

I've never had an, like, a situation where we needed to return anything Right. And we went out to do it...

The only time that we had it where it was really bad, we just took the item off the menu for a couple days until we got our next shipment in. But those the Kiwis were just disposable."
```

### 7. Future Technology Wishes

**Q - "If you had access to unlimited technology resources, what solutions would you implement to make your job easier?"**

```
"I would say the 2 main things for sure. For 1, an inventory system to be, like, just automatic. Right? So, like, as soon as I'm low on an item, that like, I get an order for it, and, ideally, that comes within the next couple days rather than on a once a week basis...

But what would really be helpful is, like, an inventory tracking system for my online orders. Right. So a way to which I know exists because there's a couple other, online hosting platforms that we've been looking at that they have an inventory system on their website."
```

### 8. Business Analytics & Performance

**Q - "How would better inventory and sales tracking benefit your business operations?"**

```
"So my last question and from this, I'll conclude the interview. Mhmm. If such a solution is made, which makes your life easier. Right? Mhmm. But what is the benefit that you get from knowing how much is there in the inventory?

Definitely, I mean, you do end up. So I I experience this now because there are definitely items that I know on my menu that don't sell as well as other ones...

We got named number 1 bakery in Colorado by Yelp a couple months ago. Yes, ma'am. And my number is, like, 300 I mean, 300 for a beef curry on a Tuesday or Wednesday is not an an it's not an odd number."
```
